# Symmetric key encryption
Symmentric encryption is a type encrypton where one key used to encrypt and descrypt data.
In this we need to exchane key so that it can be used in the decryption process.
By using symmetric encryption algorithem, dat is "scrambled" so that it can't be understood by anyone who does not posses the secret key to decrypt it.

## There are two types of symmetric encryption algorithems.
1. Block algorithems: Set lengths of bits are encrypted in blocks of electronic data with the use of a specific secret key. As the data is being encrypted, the system holds the data in its memory as its waits for complete blocks.
2. Stream algorithems: Data is encrypted as it streams instead of being retained in the system's memory.
   * AES(Advanced Encryption Standard).
   * DES(Data Encryption Standard).
   * IDEA(International Data encryption Algorithem)
   * Blowfish(Drop-in replacement for DES or IDEA)
   * RC4(Rivest Cipher 4)
   * RC5(Rivest Cipher 5)
   * RC6(Rivest Cipher 6)
